From the first moments of design, it is important to build the electronics purposefully for the given task. A well-designed circuit contains exactly as many components as necessary to perform its task properly. The designer never loses focus on the goal of the project they are working on for a minute. The reliability of a device designed for children is just as important as that of electronics designed for industrial environments. At the same time, in the two cases, it is almost certain that we will choose completely different solutions. System design includes preparing for the application of appropriate standards, as starting to deal with these seriously only in later stages of design could result in losses in time and cost.",

In truth, this love for printed circuit boards began in the first years of high school. At that time, computers were not yet widespread; we drew the master films for making printed circuit boards by hand. The first program I used for circuit design was a PCB design program called Smartwork for DOS. Technology has developed a lot since then; today almost every circuit we design has a high degree of integration and contains surface-mounted components. In our work, the basics are described by the IPC-2221A standard, which we use consistently throughout the entire design process.",
